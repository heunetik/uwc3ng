<div style="background: #000022; width: 100%; padding: 10px;"><li>Abilities are also bound like Ultimates in UWC3NG and 
 their commands are also displayed next to their skill name in the menu<br>
 <li>There are 2 shops in UWC3NG where magical items can be bought, these range 
  from items that increase your speed or attack abilities to some that will disguise 
  you like the enemy or allow you to spawn in the enemy camp at the start of a 
  round. More information is available by saying <b>/itemsinfo</b><br>
 
 <li>One skill that is new to UWC3NG
 is called Mend Wounds and beside being useful to your team by allowing you to 
 heal damage, cure poison and ease burns, it also provides a reliable source of 
 earning experience. <br>
 <li>You can reset your current skills by saying <b>/resetskills</b> - at the 
  start of the next round your points will be returned and you may retrain a new 
  set of skills. If by slim chance you ever want to delete your skills and XP 
  you can do so with <b>/deletexp</b></div>
