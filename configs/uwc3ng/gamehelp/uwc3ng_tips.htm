</div>
<div style="background: #000022; width: 100%; padding: 10px;">This is not the 
 Warcraft3 plugin you are used to, the favorite race you want to play isn't here, 
 but all your favorite skills and abiltiies are, plus many more. The following 
 are some helpful tips for players new to WC3 and veterans of WC3 alike.<br>
 <br>
 <li>There is no race menu, all skills are available via the skillsmenu 
 by saying /selectskill <br>
 <li>Each page of skills has a 
 corresponding page with info about each skills listed, page 1 skills info is 
 accessed by saying <b>/skillsinfo1</b> ... page 5 skills are accessed 
 by saying <b>/skillsinfo5</b> <br><li>In Ultimate Warcraft3 NG you 
 gain levels and skills by earning experience. You earn experience by killing 
 your enemies or seriously injuring them (assisting a teammate in killing), performing 
 game objectives like planting the bomb or rescuring hostages, and other skill 
 based methods such as healing your teamates or repairing their armor.<br><li>Ultimate skills in UWC3NG each 
 have a unique command to bind to a key, the skillsmenu (/selectskill) displays 
 these commands next to Ultimate skills. </div>
